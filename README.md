# CS_300_Project_Portfolio
In this series of projects, I tackled the challenge of building a course planner system capable of efficiently managing and displaying Computer Science course information and prerequisites. The main problem was structuring the data for quick retrieval and minimal memory usage, especially with a potentially large dataset. By using a map for fast, key-based access to courses and a vector to store prerequisites, I was able to optimize both run-time efficiency and memory utilization. Understanding the strengths of various data structures was essential to solving this problem effectively, highlighting the importance of data structure knowledge in developing efficient programs.
Through this work, I encountered and overcame challenges in parsing and organizing data, which deepened my problem-solving skills. Breaking down tasks into manageable functions helped me create a modular and adaptable code structure. This experience has expanded my approach to software design, emphasizing the importance of readability, maintainability, and adaptability in writing quality code. By prioritizing clear organization and thorough documentation, I produced a solution that not only fulfills its intended functionality but also remains accessible for future updates or modifications.
